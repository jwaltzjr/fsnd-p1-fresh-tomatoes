Fresh Tomatoes Movie Trailer Website


Description
-----------

This program creates a website of movie trailers.


Files
------------------

media.py - This file contains the Movie class which holds information like
title, trailer, and cast.

entertainment_center.py - This file has a list called movies that
contains Movie objects and can be imported into other files. If this
file is run as a script it will generate a website of movie trailers for
the movies included in the movies list and open it in a web browser.

fresh_tomatoes.py - This file has the logic to build the webpage. It
originated from the link below from Udacity's Full Stack Web Developer
Nanadegree program. Small changes were made to allign variable names and 
include more information like a summary of the movie and the cast.
